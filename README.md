Recipe Finder üç≤

```markdown
This project is a **Recipe Finder** built with React that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients and filter results by various criteria. The application utilizes JSON data from the Spoonacular API to dynamically display recipe options, implementing form handling, async-await functions, and promise-based data fetching.

## Key Concepts in This Project

- **JSON**: Recipe data is fetched in JSON format from the Spoonacular API, then displayed on the app.
- **Form Data**: Users enter ingredient names into a search form, which triggers a query to fetch recipes matching the ingredients.
- **Promises / Async-Await**: The app fetches data asynchronously using `async-await`, ensuring a smooth user experience by allowing non-blocking API requests and responsive UI updates.

## What I Created

I built a responsive and user-friendly **Recipe Finder** app using React. This project provided hands-on experience with working with APIs, handling JSON data, and managing form data in React. I learned a lot about asynchronous JavaScript concepts like Promises and `async-await`, and applied responsive design principles to ensure a great user experience across all devices.
